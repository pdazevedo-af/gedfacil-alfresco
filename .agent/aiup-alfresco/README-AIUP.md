# aiup-alfresco

A [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) plugin and portable prompt pack for Alfresco extension development. It packages the workflow as command specs, skills, and agents so the same repository guidance can be reused from Claude, Codex, OpenClaw, or another coding agent.

AIUP (AI Unified Process) is a spec-driven approach to AI-assisted development. This project applies AIUP principles to Alfresco extensions.

> If this project keeps expanding in scope and quality, it may eventually supersede the guidance currently collected in [alfresco-developer-series](https://github.com/aborroy/alfresco-developer-series).

## Prerequisites

- Java 17+
- Maven 3.9+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) CLI installed and configured if you want native slash commands

## Installation

```bash
claude plugin install aborroy/aiup-alfresco
```

Or for local development:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/aiup-alfresco
```

If you are using Codex, OpenClaw, or another agent, installation is optional; you can use the portable renderer below directly from the repository checkout.

## Portable Use Outside Claude

The slash-command UX is Claude-specific, but the command logic is portable because it lives in `commands/*.md` and `AGENTS.md`.

List the available commands:

```bash
./scripts/aiup-command.sh list
```

Render a Codex-compatible prompt for `/requirements`:

```bash
./scripts/aiup-command.sh render --agent codex requirements \
  "We need to manage technical documents with categories and review dates"
```

Render an OpenClaw-compatible prompt for `/scaffold`:

```bash
./scripts/aiup-command.sh render --agent openclaw scaffold
```

The renderer emits a plain prompt that tells the target agent to:

- read `AGENTS.md`
- execute the requested `commands/<name>.md`
- handle any referenced `skills/` or `agents/` files manually

See [PORTABILITY.md](./PORTABILITY.md) for the non-Claude workflow.

## Quick Start

**Run the workflow** inside Claude Code:

   **In-Process extensions** (behaviours, web scripts, actions, workflows — deployed as JAR/AMP inside ACS):

   ```
   /requirements        # Gather requirements + decide project architecture
   /scaffold            # Generate pom.xml, module.properties, module-context.xml
   /content-model       # Generate content model XML
   /workflow            # Generate Activiti BPMN process + workflow task model (optional)
   /web-scripts         # Generate Web Script descriptors & controllers
   /behaviours          # Scaffold behaviours/policies
   /actions             # Scaffold action executors
   /docker-compose      # Generate full ACS stack compose.yaml
   /test                # Generate integration tests
   ```

   **Out-of-Process extensions** (event listeners — deployed as a separate Spring Boot app):

   ```
   /requirements        # Gather requirements + decide project architecture
   /scaffold            # Generate pom.xml, Application.java, application.properties
   /events              # Generate Spring Boot event listener
   /docker-compose      # Generate full ACS stack + listener service compose.yaml
   /test                # Generate integration tests
   ```

   **Mixed extensions** (both in-process and out-of-process components):

   ```
   /requirements        # Gather requirements + decide project architecture
   /scaffold            # Generate aggregator POM + both sub-module skeletons
   /content-model       # Generate content model XML  (platform sub-module)
   /behaviours          # Scaffold behaviours/policies (platform sub-module)
   /events              # Generate Spring Boot event listener (events sub-module)
   /docker-compose      # Generate full ACS stack compose.yaml
   /test                # Generate integration tests for both modules
   ```

   **Legacy Share/UI extensions** (Share-tier addons such as `share-config-custom.xml`, Surf, Aikau):

   ```
   /requirements        # Gather requirements + decide whether Share is really the UI target
   /scaffold            # Generate a Share-only project or a mixed repo+share/events layout
   /share-config       # Generate Share forms and share-config-custom.xml
   /surf               # Generate Surf pages, components, and extension metadata
   /aikau              # Generate Aikau pages, widget models, and dashlet-style UI
   ```

   Share-tier architecture is now modeled explicitly at the planning and scaffolding level.
   `/share-config`, `/surf`, and `/aikau` are available now.

Notes:

- `/scaffold` is the gate for every generation command; if `REQUIREMENTS.md` does not exist yet, run `/requirements` first.
- `/content-model`, `/web-scripts`, `/behaviours`, and `/actions` are only valid when the architecture includes a Platform JAR project.
- `/share-config` is only valid when the architecture includes a Share JAR project.
- `/surf` is only valid when the architecture includes a Share JAR project.
- `/aikau` is only valid when the architecture includes a Share JAR project.
- `/events` is only valid when the architecture includes an Event Handler project.
- Share-tier architecture is now a first-class outcome of `/requirements` and `/scaffold`.
- `/docker-compose` is the convergence point before `/test`; container-based tests expect `compose.yaml` to exist.
- After `/scaffold`, the applicable generator commands can be run in any needed order, although `/content-model` is usually generated early when later code binds to custom types or aspects.

## Skills

Skills are invoked automatically by Claude during command execution:

- **content-model-validator** — validates model XML structure and naming *(In-Process)*
- **docker-compose-healthcheck-injector** — ensures healthchecks on all services *(Both)*
- **sdk-version-detector** — detects In-Process vs Out-of-Process SDK and adjusts generated code *(Both)*
- **event-api-topology-checker** — validates ActiveMQ topic names and event consumer patterns *(Out-of-Process)*

## Agents

- **alfresco-architect-agent** — proposes full extension architecture from business requirements
- **alfresco-migrator-agent** — analyses existing AMPs/JARs and produces migration plans
- **alfresco-debugger-agent** — diagnoses stack traces and suggests fixes

```

## Hooks

Three hooks fire automatically during development:

| Hook | Trigger | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| **pre-commit** | `git commit` with staged `*-model*.xml` or `*-context.xml` | Blocks commit until `content-model-validator` passes |
| **post-generate** | `Edit`/`Write` of artefacts from `/content-model` through `/test` | Reminds to update traceability in `REQUIREMENTS.md` |
| **on-error** | Failed `mvn`/`mvnw` command | Invokes `alfresco-debugger-agent` with error output |

## ROADMAP

The current workflow covers the core Alfresco extension paths first. The following areas are planned next so the repository can guide a broader set of real-world implementations:

- **Scheduled jobs**: repository cron-style jobs, Spring/Quartz schedulers, maintenance and batch jobs, and recurring tasks initialized at bootstrap time
- **Bootstrap and upgrade mechanics**: module components, repository patches, data bootstrap loaders, and upgrade tasks
- **Rule framework extras**: folder rule setup patterns, rule conditions, and admin-facing rule configuration assets beyond standalone action executers
- **Custom transforms and renditions**: custom transform engines, mimetype registration, rendition definitions, thumbnails, and transform routing
- **UI extensions**: Share/Surf/Aikau extensions, Share forms, dashlets, evaluators, and ADF/ACA/ADW frontends
